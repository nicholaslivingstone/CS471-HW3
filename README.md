# HW 3 README
## Nicholas Livingstone CS471 Spring 2020
## Friday October 2nd, 2020

- The homework report is in the directory HW3/Report and is called *hw3 report.pdf*
- The code for this homework is located in
  HW3/Code and is documented in the appendix
  of the report.
- Data produced in the prgram is exported to *HW3/data/*
- Figures generated that are found in the report can be found under *HW3/figures*
- Figures in the report were generated using a python script and the library matplotlib.
  The script was run using the Anaconda Distr. of Python 3.7.4
- To reproduce data in the report
1. Compile *trapezoidal.f90* using `gfortran trapezoidal.f90 -o trap.out`
2. Run `./trap.out`
3. Compile the object file for *gq.f90* using `gfortran -O3 -c gq.f90`
4. Link *lglnodes.f90* and compile the exectuable using `gfortran -o gq_test.x  gq.o lglnodes.o`
5. Run `./gq_test.x`
* this program will output to the screen to show progress as it takes some time to run
6. Both files will output their respective data files when run. 

Notes: 
* All python code had to be left at the top level and could not be placed in a folder as
the script was having issues accessing the necessary locations for data processing when in another
location. 
* The graph created by *derivative_plot.py* was not used in the final version of the report but the
figure generated by the script and the script itself were left for refernce.
